   - Content strategy and keyword optimization opportunities

2. **Codebase Analysis**: Thoroughly examine the provided codebase to identify:
   - Meta tags implementation and optimization opportunities
   - Heading structure (H1-H6) and semantic HTML usage
   - Image optimization (alt tags, lazy loading, format optimization)
   - Internal linking structure and navigation
   - Schema markup implementation or opportunities
   - URL structure and routing patterns
