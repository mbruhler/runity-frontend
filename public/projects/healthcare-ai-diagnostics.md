## Project Overview

The AI-Powered Medical Diagnostics Platform represents a breakthrough in medical technology, combining advanced artificial intelligence with medical expertise to revolutionize diagnostic imaging. This platform assists radiologists and physicians in detecting diseases earlier and more accurately than ever before.

## The Challenge

MedTech Innovations Group approached us with a vision to democratize access to expert-level medical diagnostics:

- **Radiologist Shortage**: Many regions face severe shortages of specialized radiologists, leading to delayed diagnoses
- **Human Error**: Fatigue and workload contribute to an estimated 5% error rate in radiology readings
- **Time Constraints**: Average turnaround time for complex imaging studies was 24-48 hours
- **Cost Barriers**: Expert second opinions were expensive and time-consuming to obtain

## Our Solution

### AI Architecture
We developed a sophisticated multi-modal AI system capable of analyzing various types of medical imaging:

#### Computer Vision Pipeline
