## Project Overview

The Smart City IoT Infrastructure project represents one of the most ambitious urban technology deployments in recent history. By creating an interconnected network of sensors, systems, and services, we've transformed how the city operates, making it more efficient, sustainable, and responsive to citizen needs.

## The Challenge

The Metropolitan Development Authority faced mounting challenges in managing a growing city:

- **Infrastructure Aging**: Legacy systems unable to meet modern demands
- **Resource Waste**: Inefficient energy and water usage costing millions annually
- **Traffic Congestion**: Average commute times increased 40% over five years
- **Emergency Response**: Delayed response times due to lack of real-time information
- **Environmental Impact**: Rising pollution levels and carbon emissions

## Our Approach

### Phased Implementation
We adopted a phased rollout strategy, starting with pilot programs in select districts before city-wide deployment:

1. **Phase 1**: Traffic management and parking systems
2. **Phase 2**: Energy and utility monitoring
3. **Phase 3**: Public safety and emergency services
4. **Phase 4**: Environmental monitoring and waste management

### Technology Stack Selection
